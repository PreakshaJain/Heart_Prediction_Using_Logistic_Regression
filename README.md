# Heart_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression
It contains python code to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes using logistic regression.
Dataset used: UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset

The system is being developed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on key medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, maximum heart rate, chest pain type, and other relevant factors.
Dataset The Heart Disease UCI dataset contains 303 observations and 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. The data has already been cleaned and preprocessed, so no additional preprocessing was needed for this project.

Modeling Logistic regression was chosen as the machine learning algorithm for this project because it is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that works well with binary classification problems like heart disease prediction. The logistic regression model was built using scikit-learn in Python. 

Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on the test set, which indicates that it is a good predictor of heart disease. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score were also calculated to assess the performance of the model.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting the presence of heart disease in patients.It will not replace professional medical diagnosis or treatment planning. Predictions are based solely on the input dataset attributes; the system does not consider lifestyle, genetic history beyond provided features, or real-time patient monitoring.The system will function as a decision-support tool, not as a diagnostic or prescriptive medical application.
